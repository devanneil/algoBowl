Backtracking from node graph
    Each node stores a "parent" field, and each edge stores all the information for the move
Test on everyone's computer
    Once backtracking is working we all need to test it to make sure we can all do outut verifications
Output verifying
    We can use our existing output verification script, but I cannot guaruntee our output is any good
    I'll get a bunch of outputs saved on my desktop, which is fairly fast
    We can also change the size of our input
Tune max depth and max children
    These can be changed in the function call
    Max depth is the same as max moves
    Max children controls how many children of each state we evaluate
    I did accidentally get 11,000
Parallelize tree search
    (Devan) I will take care of this
Optimize Heuristics
    (Devan) I will take care of this too
main.py
    Take a file in as input, make an output, verify our output
    We need to test against small outputs and odd outputs to be sure our code won't crash and burn
